# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

### Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to analyze the employment database of a company to find the employees who are retiring and to which position they belong to. Data was first taken from initial databases, from which, specific needed information was recopilated and added to output tables from which we got our final results. This results are essential thanks to a mentorship program being prepared for the employees in the incoming waves of retirement. 

### Results
After all the calculations and recopilations from the different tables, we can see in the first deliverable how many employees are going to retire and to which position they belong. 

*Insert retiring titles

- From the image result shown, we can see that the most affected position will be the Senior Engineer, followed by the Senior Staff and Engineers. For this output we utilized the "employees" file, in which the names, dates and posiiton were taken, apart from the creation of other 2 tables ("retirement_titles" and "unique_titles") that helped compile the final information.
- The creation of the last 2 tables mentioned, helped incredibly to show the relevant information of counts and posiitons that there actually in the first taken file, since it showed a ton of data and based on the creation of new tables it could be compiled in a easy and visual way for the user. 

* Insert Mentorship eligibility table

- Thanks to the joined tables from the beginning of the code ("employees" and "titles"), we could create a compiled in which indicates the employee number, name, dates and titles. All these when needed specific data from each elegible employee.
