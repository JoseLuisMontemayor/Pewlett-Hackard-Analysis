# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

### Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to analyze the employment database of a company to find the employees who are retiring and to which position they belong to. Data was first taken from initial databases, from which, specific needed information was recopilated and added to output tables from which we got our final results. This results are essential thanks to a mentorship program being prepared for the employees in the incoming waves of retirement.
